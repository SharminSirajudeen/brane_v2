# 🧠 BRANE - Master TODO

**Last Updated**: October 1, 2025
**Repository**: https://github.com/SharminSirajudeen/brane_v2
**Current Branch**: main

---

## 📍 What We're Building

**BRANE** - Privacy-first AI agent orchestration platform

**Target Users**: Healthcare, Legal, Finance professionals
**Key Feature**: Users bring their own models (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
**Value Prop**: Zero vendor lock-in, complete data ownership, HIPAA compliant

---

## ✅ What's COMPLETE

### Backend (100% Done)
**Location**: `/backend/`

- ✅ FastAPI backend with all APIs working
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with Alembic migrations
- ✅ Google OAuth + JWT authentication
- ✅ Neuron core (AI agent with 4-layer memory)
- ✅ NeuronManager (multi-agent orchestration)
- ✅ LLM Broker (model-agnostic via LiteLLM)
- ✅ Axon (FAISS vector store with encryption)
- ✅ Synapse (MCP plugin system)
- ✅ Streaming chat API with SSE
- ✅ RAG API (document upload/search)
- ✅ Admin API (users, audit logs)
- ✅ Docker Compose setup
- ✅ Complete tests and validation

**API Endpoints**: 20+ fully working
**Code**: 13,000+ lines, zero placeholders

### Example Configurations (100% Done)
**Location**: `/config/neurons/`

- ✅ Medical Assistant (HIPAA-compliant, Tier 0)
- ✅ Legal Research Assistant (Privilege-aware, Tier 1)
- ✅ Financial Analyst (SOC2-compliant, configurable tier)

### Landing Page Files (100% Done)
**Location**: `/landing/`

## ❌ What's BROKEN/INCOMPLETE

### 1. Landing Page NOT Deploying to GitHub Pages ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Problem**: https://sharminsirajudeen.github.io/brane_v2/ shows README instead of landing page

**Root Cause**: GitHub Pages using Jekyll to render README.md instead of index.html

**Needs**: Fix deployment so landing page actually shows

### 2. No React Frontend for BRANE App ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Problem**: Landing page is just marketing. No actual app to USE BRANE.

**What's Missing**:
- React web app that connects to backend APIs
- Chat interface to talk to Neurons
- Neuron management UI
- Document upload UI for RAG
- User dashboard

**Current State**: Backend works, but no way for users to interact with it

### 3. Backend Not Deployed Anywhere
**Problem**: Backend only works on localhost

**Needs**: Deploy backend to:
- Option A: Railway / Render / Fly.io (cloud)
- Option B: User's own server (on-premise instructions)

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1: Fix Landing Page (30 min)
- [ ] Delete useless files from repo
- [ ] Fix GitHub Pages deployment
- [ ] Verify landing page shows at https://sharminsirajudeen.github.io/brane_v2/

### Priority 2: Build React Frontend (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create React app in `/frontend/` folder
- [ ] Build chat interface (connects to `/api/chat/*`)
- [ ] Build Neuron management (connects to `/api/neurons/*`)
- [ ] Build document upload (connects to `/api/rag/*`)
- [ ] Build user dashboard
- [ ] Deploy frontend

### Priority 3: Deploy Backend (1 day)
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database (cloud or local)
- [ ] Configure Google OAuth credentials
- [ ] Deploy backend to cloud/server
- [ ] Test all APIs work live
- [ ] Update frontend to use live backend URL

### Priority 4: Integration (1 day)
- [ ] Connect frontend to live backend
- [ ] Test full workflow: login → create neuron → chat → upload docs
- [ ] Fix any bugs
- [ ] Update landing page with "Try BRANE" button → live app
